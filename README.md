# Safari Bookmarklet
The Safari Books [website](https://www.safaribooksonline.com) has
a queue of books that you have read/want to read.

This bookmarklet will load up all the books on the queue
page and then dump the book data into a JSON string.

The JSON object will contain the book title and the percentage
of the book that has been read by you.

## Usage
1. Go to your queue page on Safari Books
2. Copy paste this javascript into your browser
3. Append "javascript:" to the front of what you just copy pasted
4. Press enter and let the bookmarklet do its magic
